                        <h2>Mend is:</h2>
                        <p>Mend started as a concept, an idea that <strong>the body works as a whole</strong> versus as individual parts.</p>
                        <p>We all know this but the health system we work in does not allow us to treat people as whole. Today the insurance companies require physical therapists to treat the body part, not the body; insurance companies make the requirements for how many or how few sessions a person needs based on a diagnosis; they even limit the time spent with patients by limiting the amount they will reimburse the companies. Insurance companies do not take into consideration all of the other factors that can contribute to pain such as a previous injury or surgery.</p>
                        <p>As a result there are so many people who continue to have treatable pain. People who continue to need someone to guide them through a tough time or help them on occasion when their pain returns. They need someone to look at their whole body. For example, we saw a person the other day who was having lateral hip pain and upon evaluation the problem was actually in her thoracic-lumbar spine. We corrected the problem in the spine and her hip pain reduced. If she would have seen a traditional physical therapist, the prescription would have likely been for hip pain and the physical therapist may or may not have actually looked at the thoracic spine.</p>
                        <p>Hence<strong> Mend Physical Therapy was started </strong>.</p>

                        <blockquote><span class="quote">“</span>As a life long trained dancer, and as a Pilates and Gyrotonic trainer, movement is of central importance to all aspects of my life and career. When my leg was run over by a pickup truck and required surgery on my ankle and knee I was devastated. Luckily, I have been able to do my physical therapy with Julie. She has a keen intuition backed by a vast knowledge base. She has a great ability to <strong>see the greater picture</strong> in terms of overall function and movement patterning of the body and the skills to facilitate effectively the healing process. My surgeon was astounded at my recovery. I don’t believe it would have been possible without Julie’s skills and talents as a physics therapist.<span class="quote">”</span>
